# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis
A comprehensive data analysis project using Power BI to visualize key trends and insights from the Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.csv dataset. The interactive dashboard (Electric_Vehicle_Analysis_final.pbix) explores EV market growth, geographical distribution, and vehicle characteristics.
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data, visualized through an interactive **Power BI Dashboard (`Electric_Vehicle_Analysis_final.pbix`)**.

The analysis is built upon the source data file, **`Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.csv`**, exploring key trends, statistics, and insights related to the EV market, adoption rates, and various vehicle characteristics. The dashboard is designed to offer a dynamic and intuitive understanding of the current EV landscape based on the provided source data.

## Key Features & Analysis Areas

The dashboard focuses on several critical areas of EV analysis, allowing users to drill down and explore specific segments of the market:

* **Data-Driven Insights:** Visualizations created directly from the **`Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.csv`** file.
* **Geographical Distribution:** Likely includes visualizations of EV density and adoption rates across relevant regions (suggested by internal Power BI metadata to be US states).
* **Vehicle Metrics:** Analysis of factors such as battery type, electric range, vehicle make, and model popularity.
* **Market Trends:** Tracking key metrics such as vehicle count, sales, or adoption growth over time.

## Data Source

The source data for this project is the included CSV file: **`Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.csv`**.

* **Project Files:**
    * **Dashboard:** `Electric_Vehicle_Analysis_final.pbix`
    * **Data Source:** `Electric Vehicle Data Analysis.csv`
* **Note:** The Power BI file is directly connected to this CSV file. For the dashboard to function correctly and refresh, both files must be kept in the same directory.
